> This is left as a bare-minimum implementation. Doing a different transition effect is a matter of tweaking the `in` and `out` directives and their options &mdash; [learn more about Svelte transitions here](https://svelte.dev/docs#template-syntax-element-directives-transition-fn).

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
